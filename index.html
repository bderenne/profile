    <h2>Programmer & Growth expert</h2>
    <p>I worked for the last 2 years in a startup specialized in virtual reality & 3d.
    I was in charge of marketing to grow the notoriety & image of this startup named MeshroomVR.
    Prior to this experience, I worked for a group media (TFO) in Toronto as Marketing specialist.
    I began my career in a french & European basketball Team (Nanterre 92).
    I developed several departments ( ticketing, communication, Public relation & event).
    Now, I want to learn code to be more specialized in product development and growth marketing.
    I'm so determined and eager to acquire new knowledge! I also want to learn how to collaborate with a team to develop a product!</p>
